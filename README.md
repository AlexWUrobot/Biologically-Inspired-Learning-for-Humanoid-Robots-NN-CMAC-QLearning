# Biologically-Inspired-Learning-for-Humanoid-Robots-NN-CMAC-QLearning

The NAO humanoid robot is implemented by biologically-inspired learning including Neural Network, CMAC Network and Q-Learning.
The NAO robot successfully completes three tasks.
1. Tracking color blob by neural network https://youtu.be/5xhpEhaldfA.
2. Tracking color blob by CMAC network https://youtu.be/Atshz2vyHL4
3. Avoiding the goalkeeper and scoring goals by Q-learning video is https://youtu.be/Sw6Z3oO7lWQ
